# Task 1: Evaluate Different SCM Tools
**Start by comparing centralized and distributed version control systems. What are the key differences between tools like Subversion (SVN) and Git?**

SVN = centralized: single central repository; clients check out/commit to that server. Good for simpler linear workflows and for some large-binary / legacy workflows. 

Git = distributed: every developer has a full copy of the repo (history + branches) locally; branching, merging and offline work are first-class. Dominant for modern software teams and open source.

Key differences (bite-sized)

Architecture

SVN: single central server stores history; clients operate against it. 


Git: every clone is a full repository with history; pushes/pulls between repos. 


Local work & offline capabilities

SVN: must contact server for many operations (log, commits, history).

Git: almost everything (commits, diffs, branch work, history browsing) works offline. Great for flaky networks. 


Branching & merging

SVN: branching is heavier (branches stored on server as directory), merges work but are less cheap.

Git: branching is cheap and fast; encourages feature-branch workflows and frequent local commits. 

**Evaluate the advantages and challenges of using Git in a distributed environment over a centralized system like SVN or Mercurial.**

**Advantages of git in a distributed environment**
1. Offline Workflows
2. Fast Branching & Merging
3. Resilience & Redundancy

**Challenges of Git in a distributed environment**

1.Learning Curve

2.Repository Size & Large Files


3.History Rewrites & Complexity


# Task 2: Implement Git Workflows for a Team Project
**Assume the team is developing a new web application. Developers need to work on multiple features simultaneously while maintaining a stable main branch.**

1.Feature branching

2.Pull requests for code reviews

3.Integration testing before merging code into the main branch

#### Branching Strategy

Main Branch (main)

*Always stable, production-ready.

*Protected: no direct commits, only merges via reviewed PRs.

**Develop Branch** (develop) (optional)

Integration branch where features are first merged and tested before going into main.

Useful for bigger teams; smaller teams may merge features directly into main.

**Feature Branches** (feature/<name>)

Created from main (or develop).

Used for developing individual features, bug fixes, or experiments.

Naming convention

``feature/login-auth``

`feature/shopping-cart`

``bugfix/form-validation``




# Task 3: Automate Code Quality and Deployment
Runs unit tests automatically.

Checks code quality (linting).

Deploys changes to a staging environment when tests and lint checks pass.

Is fully documented so your team knows how to use it.

üìÑ GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline Documentation
1. Pipeline Overview

This CI/CD pipeline ensures:

Every push to a feature branch ‚Üí runs lint + tests.

Every pull request into main ‚Üí runs lint + tests before merge.

Merges into main ‚Üí deploy automatically to staging environment.

2. Workflow File

Save this as .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml in your repository:

name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - 'feature/*'
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout repository
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Step 2: Setup Node.js (example for a web app)
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'

      # Step 3: Install dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # Step 4: Lint check (code quality)
      - name: Run lint
        run: npm run lint

      # Step 5: Run unit tests
      - name: Run unit tests
        run: npm test -- --coverage

  deploy-to-staging:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build-and-test
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout code
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Step 2: Deploy (example: Docker + staging server via SSH)
      - name: Deploy to staging
        env:
          SSH_HOST: ${{ secrets.STAGING_HOST }}
          SSH_USER: ${{ secrets.STAGING_USER }}
          SSH_KEY: ${{ secrets.STAGING_KEY }}
        run: |
          echo "$SSH_KEY" > deploy_key.pem
          chmod 600 deploy_key.pem
          ssh -i deploy_key.pem -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no $SSH_USER@$SSH_HOST "
            cd /var/www/app &&
            git pull origin main &&
            npm install &&
            pm2 restart app

# task 4.Enforce Security Best Practices
Git Repository Security Best Practices
1. User Access Controls
Configuration

Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP):

Developers get the minimum access needed.

Example: junior devs = read/write on feature branches only; leads = merge rights.

Role-based access (via GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket):

Admin: Full control (rare, only repo maintainers).

Maintainer/Lead: Can approve merges, manage branches.

**How it helps**

Prevents unauthorized or accidental code changes.

Limits blast radius if a developer account is compromised.

**Enforcing signed commits**

 Configuration

Generate a GPG key (for signing commits):

```python
gpg --full-generate-key
gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG
git config --global user.signingkey <YOUR_KEY_ID>
git config --global commit.gpgsign true

```

# Task 5: Handle a Real-World Git Challenge
**ConflicMerge t Resolution & Workflow Improvement**
1. Resolving the Merge Conflict
Step 1: Pull the latest changes from main


```python
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```
**Step 2: Switch to your feature branch and update it**
```python
git checkout feature/login-auth
git pull origin main
```


At this point, Git may show a merge conflict if the branch and main modified the same files/lines.

**Step 3: Identify conflicting file**s

Run:

```python
git status
```


Output example:

both modified: src/components/LoginForm.js
both modified: src/styles/form.css

**Step 4: Resolve conflicts manually**

Open the files listed. Git marks conflicts like this:
```python

<<<<<<< HEAD
<div class="login-box">Old code from main</div>
=======
<div class="auth-container">New code from feature branch</div>
>>>>>>> feature/login-auth
```


üëâ Choose the correct code (or merge them manually), then remove the conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>).

**Step 5: Mark as resolved**

```python
git add src/components/LoginForm.js src/styles/form.css
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts between feature/login-auth and main"
```

**Step 6: Push resolved branch**


```python
git push origin 
feature/login-aut
```



If merging directly to main:


```python
git checkout main
git merge feature/login-auth
git push origin main
```

2. Preventing Future Conflicts

To minimize merge conflicts, update the team‚Äôs Git workflow with these practices:

‚úÖ Smaller, Frequent Pull Requests

Long-lived branches drift from main, increasing conflicts.

Merge often with small, reviewable PRs (1‚Äì3 days max).

‚úÖ Communicate Ownership of Files

If two developers are editing the same module, discuss changes beforehand.

Use standups or Slack to coordinate.

‚úÖ Rebase Frequently

Before opening a PR, rebase onto the latest main:

git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main


Keeps history linear and reduces late surprises.

‚úÖ Enforce Branch Protection

Require PRs to be up-to-date with main before merging.

Enable ‚ÄúRequire branch to be up-to-date before merging‚Äù in GitHub/GitLab.

‚úÖ Automated CI/CD Tests

Run lint + unit/integration tests on every PR.

Blocks merging if tests fail after conflict resolution.

üìÑ Deliverable Summary
Conflict Resolution Steps

Pulled latest code from main.

Identified conflicting files with git status.
